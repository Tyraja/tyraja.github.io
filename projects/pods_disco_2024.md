I had the privilege of attending the PODS x DISCO (Physical Oceanography Dissertation Symposium and Dissertation Symposium in Chemical Oceanography) conference alongside 3 undergraduates from the University of Hawai’i at Mānoa.

I'm deeply grateful for the chance to network with principal investigators, funding agencies, and PhD students from around the world—including the USA, Canada, England, India, South Africa, and Brazil. 

I left inspired by their groundbreaking research and even more excited to start my own graduate journey next year!
