summary: "Learning about the grant writting process and Key "Do's and Don'ts of Grantwritting"
---
Developed an understanding of the grant writing process, and effective grant budgeting. Practiced reading NOFOs and writing project introductions, objective statements, and learned key “Dos and Don'ts” for developing competitive grant proposals across all  federal agencies who offer grants. 

Some Key take-aways:

-Reach out to grant directors, is this a national or regional competition? It helps if the grant comittee knows your name

-Utilize scientific data from NOAA in background when applying to NOAA grnats. This helps them easily see that you understand their Mission statement. 

- Make sure your numbers match on the buget! there are numerous budget forms to fill out, and often times, peoples detailed budget numbers dont match across the forms. Spending ample time making sure the budget is organized will make you stand out in a crowd.
