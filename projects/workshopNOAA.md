#### Key Takeaways

- **Reach out to grant directors.**  
  Find out if it’s a national or regional competition—it helps if the grant committee knows your name.

- **Use NOAA data when applying to NOAA grants.**  
  Incorporating NOAA scientific data in your background section shows you understand their mission.

- **Make sure your budget numbers match.**  
  Inconsistencies across the many budget forms are common. Double-checking your detailed numbers and organizing your budget well will help your proposal stand out.
